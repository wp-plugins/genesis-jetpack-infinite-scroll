Easily enable Genesis to use Jetpack's Infinite Scroll feature.

== Description ==

This plugin enables themes that use the StudioPress Genesis Framework to use JetPack's Infinite Scrolling functionality. The current version uses the Jetpack default settings.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `genesis-jetpack-infinite-scroll.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. You should be able to see the Jetpack options under Settings > Reading.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I change the default Jetpack settings? =

It's possible, but not without manually integrating it into your theme. The next version should have a settings panel to insert these options.

= Can I use this on other themes that don't use the Genesis Framework? =

Probably not.

= What version of Genesis does this work on? =

As of now, Genesis 2.x (HTML5) is required to use this plugin. Other versions *might* work, but they are not supported (nor should you be using those anyhow).

= How does this work? =

The plugin assigns an ID to `<content>` and the footer widgets widget area (if that exists), which is what jetpack looks for to work properly. It also uses the `genesis_do_loop` instead of the standard WordPress loop that Jetpack normally looks for, and removes pagination to keep errant clicks from breaking the functionality.
